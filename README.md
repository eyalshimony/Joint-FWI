Joint Source-Structure Full Waveform Inversion Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing

This repository contains the accompanying code and reproduction scripts for the article: "Joint Source-Structure Full Waveform Inversion Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing".
This project implements a novel framework for simultaneously inverting for seismic source parameters and subsurface structural properties, specifically tailored for the high spatial density of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data.

Repository Structure

The codebase is organized by the dimensionality of the problem space:

2D/: Contains the implementation and reproduction scripts for the 2-D synthetic experiments described in the article.

3D/: Contains the implementation for the 3-D inversion cases.

Prerequisites & Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need a standard scientific Python environment, SPECFEM2D and SPECFEM3D.
